I just finished [Zero To One](http://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296) By Peter Thiel. It was definitely a pretty good book here are some of the highlights:

### **Competition is for losers**

* entrepreneurs should embrace monopolies
* anyone trying to start a company should shoot to dominate a small industry and create a "mini-monopoly"


### **Start-up Anti-Principles**

* Be humble and make incremental advances
* Stay lean and experiment agnostically
* Don't try to create new markets all of a sudden
* Focus on product, not sales

### **Start-up True-Principles**

* Start-ups should be bold
* Have a clear and concise plan
* Try to build a small monopoly
* sales matter as much as product.

### **On Venture Capital**

* The biggest secret in venture capital is that the best investment in a successful fund equals or outperforms the entire rest of the fund combined
* the power law applies to VC investments 

### **Important Questions ...**

* What important truth do very few people agree with you on?
